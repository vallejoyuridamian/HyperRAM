Memory Usage

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset

                                    Page 3




Design:  Tb_clock_divider                              Date:  07/03/22  12:04:20

GSR Usage (cont)
----------------
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'reset_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components with synchronous local reset also reset by asynchronous GSR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to ENABLED and the local reset
     is synchronous. The components will respond to the synchronous local reset
     and to the unrelated asynchronous reset signal 'reset_c' via the GSR
     component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 31
